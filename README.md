# BW Compendium FVTT

This repository contains materials for use with [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](https://foundryvtt.com/).

## Introduction

This is a set of Compendiums for Foundry Virtual Tabletop that are compatible with [StasTserk Burning Wheel Module](https://github.com/StasTserk/foundry-burningwheel), for the [Burning Wheel](https://www.burningwheel.com/burning-wheel/) tabletop RPG. I am not associated with either StasTserk or the BWHQ, and this is an independent work based off some files shared in the [Burning Wheel Discord](https://discord.gg/kdcjAgS).

This particular version is a fork of the initial work by [PauloDeTiege](https://github.com/PauloDeTiege) and [A554551N](https://github.com/A554551N).
